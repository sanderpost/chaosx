# chaosx

## Project Description

Chaosx is a project that models chaotic systems using machine learning techniques. It leverages LSTM networks to predict behaviors based on principal component analysis (PCA) of input data. The project can leverage CUDA for accelerated computations.

The project uses a fixed dataset containing individuals and their behaviors. From these individuals and behaviors, a chaotic connected network is created to model complex interactions and predict future states.

## Setup Instructions
